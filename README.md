## Learning.c
### Goal 
The goal of `Learning.c` is to build a foundational understanding of how to program the MSP432 microcontroller. This includes learning how the board interprets code, how its internal components function, and how to write basic control logic using bitwise operations. These fundamentals are essential for later stages of the project, specifically, developing a sound-following robot.

To accomplish this, we practice reading analog inputs and preparing them for digital processing by the microcontroller. This involves both signal amplification and proper interpretation of input data through code. Mastering these concepts is a key step toward enabling the robot to react accurately to sound stimuli.
